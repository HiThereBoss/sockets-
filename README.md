## Introduction
The following is the source code for my solo-project, which is a client-server based chatting application.
There needs to be a server running for the app to work.
Clients can join from anywhere around the world!

[Interface/Application program](interface.py)

[Server program](server.py)

The [data](data.txt) file holds local client data.

The [server data](server_data.txt) file should be located in the same directory as the server file, and stores server data (such as message history).
Other directories include (outdated) compiled .exe applications that were meant for distribution to testers.
